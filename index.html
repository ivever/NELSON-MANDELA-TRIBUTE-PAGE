        <p>People described Nelson Mandela as a man of peace, he had a powerful presence and disarmed enemies with his smile. He showed the world what forgiveness looks like.
            He was positive, thinking about what could be, he was a visionary and could see the big picture.
            He was focused on goals and a mission beyond himself.
            He had remarkable endurance, he showed grit and determination.
            He was humble.
            He was full of hope, not hate, he was patient.
